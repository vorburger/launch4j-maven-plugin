# Launch4J Maven Plugin Repository Situation

I have discovered that the base which should have been used was not.

Available in this repo are three branches. This one is a continuation of the fork
which is simply here to mark the situation until it's properly resolved. oldmaster
is Paul's work, with 6 years of history. Finally, forkedmaster is what you should
base your work on for the time being until I graft the two repositories together.

Thanks for your patience while I resolve this.

Fred.
